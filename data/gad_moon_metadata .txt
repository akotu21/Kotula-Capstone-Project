gad_cleaned.csv metadata

This dataset includes amphibian survey data collected on SLU campus by Dr. Ashpole's Global Amphibian Decline class dating back to fall 2014. Samples were collected by students in the class using a variety of different survey methods on a nightly basis from late August until the end of October. The dataset is updated on a yearly basis upon the conclusion of GAD class surveying, however GAD was not offered every year so some years lack observations. 

Key:
Activity - what the amphibian was doing upon observation
SpeciesName - The common name of the species
OBJECTID - the number of the observation in the dataset
Date - the date the observation was made
SiteMainCl - the general area the observation was made (campus)
SiteSubClass - a more specific area the observation was made (a part of campus)
Stage - the life stage of the amphibian
Sample - whether or not the specimen was brought to the lab and sampled
AirTemp_F - the temperature in Fahrenheit when the observation was made
WindSpeed - the relative windspeed at the time of observation
